# Project Name - Eat-that-Burger
Description: Creating a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM. Following the MVC design pattern and using Node + MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.
Designed to be used as a communication tool for fellow developers in the community and potential employers. 

# Usage
1) Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
2) Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be    devoured.
3) Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right  side of the page.
4) Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
